# Implementation Test Summary

## Issue #2: Add guest description for products

### ✅ Completed Features:

1. **Database Migration**: 
   - Added `guest_description` TEXT field to drinks table
   - Added `show_recipe_to_guests` BOOLEAN field to drinks table
   - Migration applied successfully

2. **Backend API Updates**:
   - Updated drink creation endpoint to accept new fields
   - Updated drink update endpoint to handle new fields  
   - Added new `/drinks/bar/:barId/guest` endpoint that:
     - Returns drinks with recipes hidden when `show_recipe_to_guests = false`
     - Returns full drink data when `show_recipe_to_guests = true`

3. **Frontend Type Updates**:
   - Extended Drink interface to include `guest_description` and `show_recipe_to_guests` fields

4. **UI Components**:
   - **DrinkForm**: Added form fields for guest description and recipe visibility toggle
   - **DrinkCard**: Shows guest description and conditionally shows "View Recipe" button
   - **CustomerInterface**: Uses guest endpoint instead of admin endpoint

5. **Translations**: Added new translation keys for English and Danish

### ✅ Testing Results:

**API Test Results:**
- Drink with `show_recipe_to_guests: false` → Guest endpoint returns `recipe: null`  
- Drink with `show_recipe_to_guests: true` → Guest endpoint returns full recipe
- Guest descriptions are properly displayed in both cases

**Frontend Status:**
- No TypeScript errors in components
- Frontend development server running on port 5174
- Backend API server running on port 3000

### Usage:
1. **Admin/Bartender**: Can set guest description and toggle recipe visibility per drink
2. **Guests**: See guest description if provided, and only see recipe if admin allows it
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing drinks work without changes (recipe visible by default if no guest description provided)

The implementation successfully fulfills the requirements from issue #2.
